# skills-tracker
Head to the Spring initializr to initialize a new Spring project.

For Project, select Gradle Project, for Language, select Java, and for Spring Boot, select 2.4.x (whichever is the most recent release, that is NOT a snapshot).
For Project Metadata, we can use org.launchcode as Group and skills-tracker as the artifact. Also, remember to expand Options so you can make sure that Java 11 is selected!
Finally, we want to add Spring Web and Spring DevTools as our dependencies.
Double check that everything is ready to go and click Generate!
